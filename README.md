# Client-side File encryption for implementing a zero-knowledge system  
## Google Summer of Code Project for Drupal  
#### Student: Tameesh Biswas (@tameeshb)  
#### Mentor: Colan Schwartz (@colan)  
  
## Objective  
    
This project will involve building a complete module for Drupal 8 site to make it a zero-knowledge system using front-end JS encryption so that the users can rely on the site when uploading sensitive files, including images on confidential posts, not having to worry about data being stolen in case the server gets compromised.
